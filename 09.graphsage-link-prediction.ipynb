    "In this example, we use our implementation of the [GraphSAGE](http://snap.stanford.edu/graphsage/) algorithm to build a model that predicts citation links in the Cora dataset (see below). The problem is treated as a supervised link prediction problem on a homogeneous citation network with nodes representing papers (with attributes such as binary keyword indicators and categorical subject) and links corresponding to paper-paper citations. \n",
    "\n",
    "To address this problem, we build a model with the following architecture. First we build a two-layer GraphSAGE model that takes labeled node pairs (`citing-paper` -> `cited-paper`)  corresponding to possible citation links, and outputs a pair of node embeddings for the `citing-paper` and `cited-paper` nodes of the pair. These embeddings are then fed into a link classification layer, which first applies a binary operator to those node embeddings (e.g., concatenating them) to construct the embedding of the potential link. Thus obtained link embeddings are passed through the dense link classification layer to obtain link predictions - probability for these candidate links to actually exist in the network. The entire model is trained end-to-end by minimizing the loss function of choice (e.g., binary cross-entropy between predicted link probabilities and true link labels, with true/false citation links having labels 1/0) using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) updates of the model parameters, with minibatches of 'training' links fed into the model."
